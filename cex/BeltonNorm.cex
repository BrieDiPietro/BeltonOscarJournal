urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.1.1.b#1st Another year has dawned and many hearts today may be joyous and happy. I among others have cause to be thankful and grateful for the gifts which it has pleased Our Father in Heaven to give to me and with me those I love; we have been blessed in a special manner; Mother, brothers and sisters, we have all closed a year of peculiar blessings and comforts to us; we have been spared, have been blessed with good health almost uninterruptedly and with numerous privileges which we often estimate but lightly while we possess them and never know their value until deprived of them; and how little have we felt of that gratitude which we should feel to the Giver of every good and perfect gift! Oh! God help us poor worms of the dust to feel as we should, help us render to You your due. Although this year, now past, has been one of so many blessings to me I can not feel light hearted today; this is a day which would call upon every one to think on what is painful as well as pleasing in the recollections of 1859, and many things of a painful nature do I remember- friends and relatives kind and noble have been taken; one and another of the latter near and dear have been taken in mid life. Sue a bright example, a shining ornament among the band professing to be followers of the meek and lowly Jesus in the midst of her usefulness as it seemed to us. The other a dearly beloved uncle in manhood prime almost yet wasted by a long-enduring and painful disease and, although he had followed the example of his Master in the solemn ordinance of baptism, had never been buried beneath the baptismal wave. Yet I trust, as he trusted, he had given himself up to his God, had experienced a change of heart; he had lived an honest upright life though an ungodly one, until about a year and a half ago when I believe he was by the grace of God led to feel deeply and fully realize his condition, and to find his God; he too we have good reason to believe rests in Heaven. It has been my painful privilege too to stand beside the dying bed of one in the tender years of boyhood—a young cousin—who had been a disobedient son and by many considered, as he had been I think, a bad, reckless boy; he was taken sick with the measles, recovered and spent a night from home, was taken down again and in one short week was called hence; yet thanks and praise be to God he was spared long enough to make peace with his God to acknowledge his sins and to ask his all whom he had ever offended to forgive him; when told that he must die he said he was not afraid to die and made all his preparations with great composure and calmly sank to rest. Many others of friends and relatives have been called. God, why do I mourn over these, over any who have been called home to Heaven? Neither youth nor manhood have been spared and Oh how carefully should I live that I may be ready when the summons calls me. Help me Oh! My God and enable me to devote myself anew to your service; I have served, if I have served You at all, but feebly, if I am yours enable me “to prove myself worthy of the high vocation wherewith I have been called”; if not think Oh! Make me yours—yours for ever. I have been a professor of religion for nearly two years now and often am I perplexed with doubts and fears and am led to doubt my conversion; I am so proud and stubborn and cling so firmly to my old sins. Oh! how I long for the confident consciousness of having been accepted. Help Lord my unbelief. Reflections of a similar nature to these have occupied my mind today. I must however not attempt to record reflections as my intention is simply to keep a record of whatever topics of interest, items of news, and occurrences rendering striking and other matters such a nature which I may feel disposed to preserve for future reference; I have become so disgusted, I may almost say, what I have written during last year that I had almost resolved to give up the attempt in despair; upon reading over some of it I found a conglomeration of foolishness with little of interest in it, precious little instruction or amusement to be found in it and not interesting enough to cause me to read it and were it not for a few facts in the mass I should do as I have been tempted several times to do, consign the whole mass (nearly 200 pages) of foolscap to the flames. I may however record some facts which may be of interest in days to come and may improve my hand-writing. This morning opened the New Year with the Earth clad in snow and it promises to remain some time I think; it melted slightly during the morning but turned cooler this evening and is frozen tonight—though it melted until dark. Mr. Furman preached on the shortness of life this morning, a fine sermon; not many out of course yet more than might perhaps have been expected; my feet got very cold during services. Otherwise I was quite comfortable; Charlie and I sat in the gallery. Attended Monthly Conference of Prayer this evening; Mr. Hartwell’s letter to Mr. Furman was read this evening; it was very interesting indeed. No preaching tonight in consequence of the weather. I took supper at Aunt Hannah’s; Joab and Newton Reid were there; sat some time playing with the children. Newton Reid came down with me and will stay over near the Depot and go down in the morning; he is staying at work-shops at Helena. Several took tea here and they have been singing; stopped when I came in— afraid I would join in and spoil everything as I generally do I suppose. Cold tonight and turning colder— cloudy too.

urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.1.2.b#2nd Saleday in January and the day generally observed as New Year’s Day; not much of a stir in town today however except among the darkies; don’t think I ever saw as many negroes in town at one time as I have seen today; the day has been remarkably quiet for this time of year (New Year’s Day) as well as remarkably cold. Will Shumate and Joab expected to have been engaged all day making a settlement; Shumate, Uncle Frank has appointed to make settlement with those indebted to Mauldin and Long; all amounts due them belong to Uncle Joab’s estate; Joab came up to assist him; I believe they collected about $9.00! Uncle Frank had published a notice that he would collect or sue but it does not seem to affect them much
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.1.3.h#Tuesday, Third
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.1.3.b#3rd This morning clear and cold; rode out about 2 miles with Joab; he rode a gray pony belonging to Uncle J’s estate down to Winston to fatten him up some; he had a cold ride but was well fixed for it; I got very cold before I got home. Sent Uncle Frank a letter from Judge O’Neall in answer to one from me to him (Judge O’N) asking him to come up and assist about settling up our affairs with Uncle J’s estate; he said he could not come. They have been hauling ice today but I have not seen any of it and have not been at the pond; don’t know how thick it is. Gold come up last night but has not come over yet; he is at Mrs. Anderson’s; a young man named Marsh came up with him and wanted to board with us also but we could not give him a room to himself as he wanted one; I attempted to get a place but did not succeed; he is a Theological student. Attended Prayer meeting tonight; saw Marsh out very cold; not many out but very interesting. Toy was called out and spoke, afterwards Cousin Charlie and Mr. Randolph each said a few words.
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.1.4.h#Wednesday, Fourth
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.1.4.b#4th Cold today in the extreme. Uncle Frank came up this evening but has headache tonight and I could not talk to him about the affairs which I wished to speak to him about. Wrote to Grand-pa tonight that I might come down Friday if I could find out what the trouble was about which they wanted his advice. Have been getting our accounts together today so that we could have them settled as soon as possible. Paid 50 cents for stamps today.
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.1.5.h#Thursday, Fifth
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.1.5.b#5th Have been engaged part of the day drawing off our accounts with Mauldin and Long and have been helping Cousin Charlie and Uncle Frank the balance of the time until about one o’clock tonight; Uncle Frank staid all night but I came home found it very cold indeed. Did not go out to Preaching tonight as they wanted me to come to Cousin Charlie’s and help them.
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.1.6.h#Friday, Sixth
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.1.6.b#6th Have been at Cousin Charlie’s office today helping them and they wanted me at the house tonight. Went to O’Neall’s Division Sons of Temperance tonight; Aunt Lizzie and Sissy went also; although it was very cold outside was very comfortable in the room; we installed officers; I was installed R.S.; some ladies were initiated. We took supper after we came from Division home then took Aunt Lizzie home and went to Cousin Charlie’s; staid till nearly two o’clock; did not work very much; we ate scrambled eggs, apples, and c. Uncle Frank goes home in the morning; he laid down but will not have time to get to sleep. It has been sleeting or rather a slight mist has been falling which has frozen as it fell and the ground is as slick as glass; it is as cold as I want to see it.
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.1.7.h#Saturday, Seventh
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.1.7.b#7th Wrote to Robert Watson tonight; will add something tomorrow. It has been raining nearly all day and is somewhat warmer; the sleet is melting pretty fast— in fact, has all gone except what lies on the snow of which last (the snow) some still remain. I have been in my room the greater portion of the day next to Section tonight; we elected Officers; pretty cool and damp. Have been reading Trench on Study of Words today; it is a good little work. It is twelve o’clock.
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.1.8.h#Sunday, Eighth
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.1.8.b#8th Rev. Edward Edwards a young preacher from the West preached here today (this morning); he is the first preacher I have heard ever allude to the subject of Temperance in the pulpit in many a day; he was a very wild young man and spoke very warmly in alluding to it. I think ministers neglect their duty in refraining from the mention of the subject. Sheppard a young Theological student preached a very good sermon tonight.
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.1.9.h#Monday, Ninth
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.1.9.b#9th Today has been damp and unpleasant underfoot but not cold I think. Charlie and I agreed today to go to another country party tomorrow night— 5 miles at old Mr. Moore’s and will stay at Mr. Shockley’s about 1 mile from Mr. M’s. We went out to Frank Stairley’s tonight and took supper with him. Charlie wants to go into the book business with him; he will in says; we staid until after 8 and came home through one of the heaviest fogs I have ever seen although it was clear at dark; Lady slipped her bridle and charged about inside the enclosure out there. Peter has been promising Charlie to take him in but is unreasonable in his demands and Stairley will treat him fairly.
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.1.10.h#Tuesday, Tenth
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.1.10.b#10th Today has been cloudy and foggy all day and this evening it looks very much like rain. I have just witnessed about as frightful a scene as I remember ever witnessing. I was standing just opposite the Mansion House on the other side of the street when I heard a noise and looking around saw Charlie Hammond in a two-horse buggy coming down street at full speed and discovered that they were running away with him; they ran against the scaffolding poles lying just in front an addition which Swandale is putting up to the Mansion House and threw Charlie H. out; turning out into the middle of the street they dragged him, one leg having caught over the front axle—tree to a post in front of Peter Smith’s confectionery just below new C.H. against which they ran, broke themselves loose, knocking a horse hitched to the post some 15 feet or more, and ran down the sidewalk not being injured in the least. I ran over to where Charlie H. lay and found after they had taken him to the Mansion House he was but slightly injured; his escape is truly wonderful; his horses knocked down a horse hitched to the post they ran against and taking the sidewalk ran on, uninjured themselves. Charlie, Ben McDavid, and I are going out to Mr. Moore’s (5 miles) to a party tonight; will come home in the morning; it may rain on us I think. Paid Isaac 20 cents for shawl fastening.
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.1.11.h#Wednesday, Eleventh
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.1.11.b#11th Had a fine time last night at the party, after the frolic rode 1 mile to Mr. John Shockley’s and spent the night all three in one bed; we kept warm after our feet were very cold when we retired; rose late this morning and after a very nice breakfast came home. Lady got loose at Mr. Moore’s last night and cut Albert’s leg having kicked him; we found out there was something the matter when we got to Mr. S’s and exercised him for colic; he is somewhat stiff. Gave the boy at Mr. M’s last night 25 cents. Cloudy but not cold today. Will attend a party at McCarter’s tomorrow night.
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.1.12.h#12th hursday, Twelfth
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.1.12.b#I have commenced Washington Irving’s Life of Washington; began 1st not this week and will finish by Saturday I think; intend to read pretty steadily. Has not been cold today. Went to Mr. McCarter’s tonight; not very many out; a pretty rough set. Charlie and Ben amused themselves kissing the girls most of whom had no great objection to the operation; we left about 12 and got home before 1; is only 3 miles, Albert pretty stiff.
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.1.13.h#Friday, Thirteenth
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.1.13.b#13th Have been in the house nearly all day; it has been damp and raining some. We had a very good turnout of both male and female although the night was so unfavorable. I have not been able to get R. S’s book posted up yet but will try to do so tomorrow; initiated some tonight and received propositions for more. Robert is to be here tomorrow night and I am anxious to see him.
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.1.14.h#Saturday, Fourteenth
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.1.14.b#14th This is Sam’s birthday. Rode over to meet Robert this evening but he did not come; bad weather I suppose kept him; shall look for him Monday; he wrote he would be here to attend the sale of Uncle Joab’s negroes which is Wednesday 18th. Section met tonight and installed officers.
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.1.15.h#Sunday, Fifteenth
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.1.15.b#15th Mr. Furman preached this morning a very fine sermon; I thought he had gone off as Agent for F.U. until I saw him in the pulpit; he was to have gone yesterday but one of his children was taken sick. We had communion service this evening and no preaching tonight; gave 25 cents at collection for the poor.
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.1.16.h#Monday, Sixteenth
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.1.16.b#16th The weather is somewhat milder today— almost pleasant and in fact is pleasant riding; sissy and I took a short ride this evening; Albert is stiff and of course somewhat lame. Uncle Frank came up this evening to make some arrangements about the sale Wednesday next; he will remain up until Saturday; Aaron has been busy hauling lumber over for them today from the shop back of Dr. Rd. Furman’s place. Sissy and I stopped in and bid Mr. Furman goodbye this evening; he leaves in the morning; I hope and believe he will be successful in doing much for F.U. We need it and will receive it I believe; he will be gone only a few weeks.
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.1.17.h#January Tuesday, Seventeenth
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.1.17.b#17th They have been appraising Uncle Joab’s property today; Uncle Frank thought he would need me; I went up and stayed while they were appraising the furniture which he had given Aunt Hannah and some other property and then came home finding they had no use for me. Not so very warm tonight. Mr. Arnold and Aunt Jinney are with us tonight; will stay until tomorrow evening. Robert Walton has not come yet; don’t know when he will come now. Went out to prayer meeting tonight; Mr. Arnold and Aunt J. also; had a good warm meeting.
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.1.18.h#Wednesday, Eighteenth
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.1.18.b#18th Uncle Joab’s negroes sold well today; George brought $3500; he is the best and most sensible negro I ever saw—a fine mill-wright and one of the best carpenters in town; Professor Boyce bought him; he has his wife and although everybody thought it high Professor B. was offered $4000 tonight for him. 24 negroes including children from 2 to 12 years old averaged $100. A great many people here. Say Mr. N Moore (Miss Lee’s father) from Edgefield and spoke to him of course. Rather pleasant this morning but cold tonight. Wrote to Grandpa tonight and asked him something more about our affairs as well as gave him my opinion about the matter objecting to Charlie Elford’s having anything to do with is as neither Ma nor I have any confidence in him.
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.1.19.h#January Thursday, Nineteenth
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.1.19.b#19th Absalom Blythe took dinner with us today and sat some time. Ma and the girls dined out. Mr. Moore today he came in and staid a short while this evening; no one here to receive him but me as Ma and sissy had not come back from Colonel Hare’s where they dined. Went out to church tonight; Hyde preached; not much of a sermon either.
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.1.20.h#Friday, Twentieth
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.1.20.b#20th Turned out to Division tonight; also Aunt Lizzie and sissy; we had a good attendance some initiated and others proposed; our meetings are very interesting but everything does not go on as I would wish; Jeremiah Eldridge a vagabond and scamp convicted of violation of Art. 2nd was reinstated. Shameful.
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.1.21.h#Saturday, Twenty-First
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.1.21.b#21st Warmer today. As I anticipated we will have trouble about the Eldridge case yet. Attended section tonight; have been busy all day on Washington’s Life; Washington Irving is indeed a beautiful writer.
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.1.22.h#Sunday, Twenty-Second
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.1.22.b#22nd Rose very late this morning having retired late last night. Dr. Jason C. Furman gave us an excellent sermon this morning and also tonight but not so grand as this morning. Charlie and I took a walk this evening which tired me very much and I went to sleep in church tonight in consequence. Quite pleasant today.
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.1.23.h#January Monday, Twenty-Third
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.1.23.b#23rd We are having fine weather now; as pleasant today as a summer day. Busy today reading Washington. Gold and I are going to study German under a young man named Caspari; we will recite to him tomorrow evening at 3 o’clock. I saw him last week and he pronounced the letters of the German alphabet for me.
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.1.24.h#Tuesday, Twenty-Fourth
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.1.24.b#24th Wrote to Benson today and sent him 3 bushels Of apples I bought at his request last Saturday; he will get them tomorrow. We recited in German this evening 1st time had some fun with him. Dr. Jason C. Furman conducted prayer meeting tonight and spoke very well indeed.
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.1.25.h#Wednesday, Twenty-Fifth
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.1.25.b#25th Read all the morning. This evening started out to help Aaron drive a cow and calf which he was to take up to Tyger and bring one back with a young calf; I only intended to ride a short distance but they had some trouble and I am tonight at Mr. Reese’s; we got here some time after dark. Not cold at all tonight though out-door it would be chilly; Mr. Reese had the wagon loaded tonight; I helped them; they are hauling corn down to Greenville C.H. to be shipped to Newberry to feed them one at the home place; they will send 200 bushels at this time. The roads are good—very good hard, solid, better than I have seen for several winters. Want to start very early in the morning when the wagon does.
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.1.26.h#January Thursday, Twenty-Sixth
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.1.26.b#26th Did not start home this morning till late; Mr. Reese came with us about 2 miles; Aaron and I drove on very quietly and with very little trouble; I left Aaron about 6 ½ or 7 miles from home and galloped on ahead got home after 1. Rode over to the Depot and attended to unloading, got some harness which Mr. Reese wanted me to get for the place and hurried the negroes off as they were disposed to hang around these Jew stores here detestable places that they are. Heard Shipman preach tonight and, though I like the young man’s looks, can’t say I admired his sermon; he is a regular wood-chuck preacher and rather high-flown; I would admire plain straightforward common sense much more; he did his best however and I am satisfied.
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.1.27.h#Friday, Twenty-Seventh
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.1.27.b#27th We recited our German today at least as much as we knew of it. I finished 4th vol. Washington today and borrowed the 5th from Jeter’s private library as the Society haven’t it; will begin it soon in the morning. Aunt Lizzie came down with sissy to tea tonight and went to Division; Gold joined tonight; Eldridge’s case came up and his having been erased on his confession the motion to reinstate him was lost; he is therefore in effect excluded from the Division which I think good for us; we had a good attendance out tonight and much interest manifested.
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.1.28.h#January Saturday, Twenty-Eighth
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.1.28.b#28th Read some today but have fooled away most of my time. Went to the Section tonight. Wrote to Mr. Lee tonight in reference to taking Willie if he did not get there till last of next week; also wrote to A.S. Willington and Co. Charleston S.C. Pub. Charleston courier to discontinue Mauldin and Long’s paper which they have been sending on. It is cool again tonight though not cold. It is 12 o’clock.
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.1.29.h#Sunday, Twenty-Ninth
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.1.29.b#29th Professor Edwards preached this morning a very fine sermon though a very long one—more than an hour; he is a fine scholar and gave to us the fruit of much research and long study. Charlie and I walked out to the Allston place (2 ½ miles) this evening; just about cool enough to be pleasant walking. Professor Furman preached us a fine sermon tonight; he is a splendid preacher; talking is his forte though; he is not the critical scholar that Professor Edwards is, though a man of genius (I think) and learning.
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.1.30.h#Monday, Thirtieth
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.1.30.b#30th Read all the morning and most of the evening; finished Washington tonight—all except an Appendix of 70 pages. Rode out to Mrs. Stewart’s this evening with sissy and saw Miss Hallie Black a few minutes. Mrs. S not in the house.

urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.1.31.b#31st Worked with J.A. Crowder all the morning on examples in Maxima and Minima (Calculus) in my room. Caspari was not at home and consequently we did not recite this evening. No prayer meeting tonight. I have finished Washington; it is fine interesting in the extreme. Raining today and still tonight.
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.2.1.h#February Wednesday, First
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.2.1.b#1st Cleared off cold last night and the ground was frozen hard this morning. Charlie and I rode out to Professor Furman’s this morning got pretty cold; Charlie had some business with him; we sat some time and the old fellow (I mean no disrespect) chatted very freely. Took Jeter’s 5th Vol. Washington back today. Finished Trench on Study of Words. Aunt Lizzie was down here this evening. Willie got off last night about 12 o’clock for Asheville; he went off very willingly though he objected very seriously about supper time. I have commenced taking Eclectics Magazine- like January no. very much; have not received any other yet; Charlie (and Jeter) furnish one with it at $5.00. Billy came up this evening and will go down in the morning; only saw him a short while. General Waddy Thompson spoke in the C.H. tonight before the O.C. Society; his audience rather thin (4 ladies only); his subject was Mexico discovery history, inhabitants, country, present condition, and c.; it was interesting though rather disconnected; he was rather too drunk I thought to get along well. It is very cold at present, and clear; we may look out for cold weather I think. Sissy and Sam are spending the night at Colonel Hare’s, Ma took supper over there.
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.2.2.h#February Thursday, Second
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.2.2.b#2nd Cold today indeed. Took a short ride this evening alone. Professor Edwards took tea with us tonight; I went with him to church; Reverend Jason B. Taylor of Va. preached us a very good plain sermon though he wandered somewhat I thought. Ann was taken sick today and Dr. Crook called in tonight to see her; don’t see how Ma will get along without her.
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.2.3.h#Friday, Third
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.2.3.b#3rd It is still cold very cold. This morning I got up before day and kindled a fire; quite a change for me as I have been lying in bed till late waiting for the fire to be made and not even getting up when it was kindled. This is the anniversary of the saddest day of my life. Four years ago I became a fatherless boy; an all-wise God saw fit to afflict us then but why we cannot tell yet we must not complain since it is His doings who doeth all things well. We recited to Caspari this evening. Attended Division tonight. Will. H. Harrison withdrew from the Division tonight on account of a spirit manifested as he says by members of the Division opposing him on every occasion; am sorry he withdrew yet if the case is as he represents it I will also.
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.2.4.h#Saturday, Fourth
urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.2.4.b#4th Still cool though moderating somewhat. Charlie shot at some ducks on the ponds this morning but did not kill. Bought a white Marseilles vest pattern $2.50 and 2 ¾ yards de le for pants at $1.50 from Dyer to give Vol something to do; Dyer is to pay me about $100 for Ma next Tuesday. Attended Section tonight.

urn:cts:fufa:bomauldin.journal.norm:1860.2.5.b#5th It has been raining pretty steadily today and very cold during the greater part, a cold drizzling rain fell all the morning though not so bad this evening. We had no preaching in our church so Gold, Charlie, and I went around to the Presbyterian Church and heard Mr. Willbanks who is to teach in the Gaillard School to open tomorrow over by the Depot; did not think his sermon very good. Went to Aunt Hannah’s to dinner and remained great part of the evening. No preaching anywhere tonight though I don’t think it has been raining since supper but very little.

Charley and Ben staid at the party till 12 o’clock and came home; they staid at Ben’s room the remainder of the night; Charley’s horse fell down with him and threw him bruising him pretty badly; his head and face are scratched and bruised enough to give him the appearance of having been engaged in a fight; we have laughed at him and worried him considerably today. Horne came this evening; saw him for a few minutes after preaching tonight and tried to make him stop in for a short while on his way home but could not succeed; says he likes Arkansas fine a great country he thinks; he looks like rest might help him; he has been traveling some time; he will come down and talk some in the morning.

After eating (we and our horses) we ascended the mountains without a guide. Went all over the top down into the Devil’s parlor around the Cedar Stump (cutting off the other names and writing our own with the date on it) rolled off some rocks and c; then went down to the base (I had never been there before); this sight is the best of all—the most sublime I have ever seen; just after leaving the pool a sheet of ice fell on it (it was frozen over) which had it fallen a few minutes sooner might have killed us; Gold left a Valentine for Mr. Devil is his P.O.; came down to the house a little before dark. Gold very tired, I sick with an awful headache the worst I ever had; I retired very early without any supper very unusual with men.

I have been reading Calhoun some today and am almost—if not quite convinced of the right of secession and nullification though I might have advised (I think) a different course. I have ever been a strong Union man and am yet if the Union can be preserved honorably, but have never before read anything on the subject of which Calhoun treats except Story on the Constitution and he does treat of the subject as fully as Calhoun and in fact is opposed to him in views and does not discuss those questions upon which they differ.

This has been a beautiful day very pleasant indeed. I paid Mr. W. F. Nigel’s $20.70 for Sissy and Betty’s Music Lessons and took a receipt for each one to Ma.

Attended Division tonight; we had a goodly number out and a protracted meeting; we had several questions before the Division which took some time and excited considerable interest.

Toy talked with me in reference to entering the ministry and especially the foreign field and says that the great need of Missionaries is in his opinion a direct call to all education Christian young men to consider the matter earnestly and see whether they are not called to labor there; he thinks a desire to preach constitutes a call; he thinks that we must ask ourselves the question whether we cannot do more good by preaching than in any other way. May it not be if this is the case that I am called; if I am help me O God! to feel and to enter upon whatever field thou shalt call me to; may I be given strength and wisdom to decide and to act.

There was a sunrise prayer meeting this morning at the church but I did not go, not rising in time. Attended Episcopal Church this evening but can’t say I was much edified or invested; the preacher was a stranger to me did not speak directly enough for me to understand half the words; saw the farce (cannot call it by a less harsh name) sprinkling of a negro baby (free-negro); the little chap did not seem to take much pleasure in the service was quite an unwilling subject I thought; I was much struck with the great difference between that scene and one like the one witnessed tonight at the Baptist Church where those baptized were not only willing but glad to follow the example of our Lord and Master and like him descend into a watery grave signifying by this significant and divine ordinance that this they have died to the world and rise to newness of life; it seemed to me that no candid searcher after truth can long hesitate in reference to the scriptural position on this question; Miss Jane Greenfield and several negroes were baptized tonight; Mr. Furman gave us a splendid sermon.

State House will be a magnificent affair and even should now what it will be; received $20 (10 percent on S and C R.R. Co’s assessment) for Estate of S and J Mauldin. Saw Captain J B Patrick at Arsenal Academy and paid him $5 for picture frame purchased for Adel Soc; Captain seemed glad to see me; saw drill. From the Arsenal walked up by Hampton’s Garden but could not get in we saw a part of the garden however from the outside. We met Misses Sue Wright, Mary Crosson and Mallie Black (to the last I was introduced for the third time) and we walked with them to Lyons’ garden which is a beautiful place certainly; walked through. I was very tired and as it was late we did not go back to the Arsenal to see the parade although we had intended doing so. Major Perry, Mr. Perry, Mrs. P and Miss Fannie P as well as others from Greenville are at the Congaree House; have been with Mr. P talking some; met Thomas and Mister Gary here this evening; Sweat (Lawrence J) called around to see me tonight; he is in S.C.

Johnny Jones met us where the trains meet and took us from the Depot home; he is a son of Uncle Lambert’s brother is at Lutheran College at present; has a sister; I call her Cousin Anna; she is rather pretty and quite pleasant she intends making Uncle Lambert’s her home till married; says she wants to marry; told I was at her service any time after 1st of August. I washed and cleaned up for dinner this evening Cousin Anna, Anna Ware, Betty and I went out to Grandpa’s; he is in Columbia but I did not know it till I had got here; saw Grandma and sat some time; then came to Tom Pope’s and stopped a while; I had to pull the Annas out declared they would not get out but I carried them in; Mrs. Pope and Tom were very glad to see us; the girls got a large bunch of flowers there; we then rode all around town had some few crowded up in the carriage with 8 tremendous hoops; I plagued them considerably; when we had rode all around I bought the children I called them (the girls) some oranges (35) and candy (55=90) and sent them home; went back and got shaved and walked out home.

Did not go to church this evening or tonight; Johnny and I walked downtown this evening; the Annas went to pay a visit to Miss McMorris. Tonight two young men Drake Ramage and John Kauce familiarly called came out for the girls but soon concluded it too late to go church and we spent the time foolishly chattering; badly spent indeed.

Aunt Eliza and Cousin Anna came with us to the Depot; tried to persuade Cousin A to come up with us; could not; she will be up at Commencement; I brought her likeness with me; she did not object very strongly; told her wanted to fool the people. The girls brought a great many flowers and strawberries; flowers are ruined but strawberries are not. Paid 55 cents for ice cream and c today. Uncle Frank came up to Winston from Belton.

Showed Doctor Anna Jones’ likeness and told him I was in love with her; intend to fool him if I can and keep him in the dark. Studied this evening at Captain’s room and attended prayer meeting tonight; few out; there is a show in town “Swiss Bell Singers” and most of those who should have been at church were there I suppose listening to little foolery. Got $1 from McDavid and Duncan and paid Mr. Furman for Mr. Hartwell’s support by this church; also got auto for the other children making it $5 in all and gave him besides $5 from Ma.

Y.J. and I took a walk tonight and stopped in at Captain’s room as we came back and talked some time with him; he and Dr. Furman (Pres) worked on Captain’s speech for May Anniversary of Adelphian Society but Captain didn’t finish reading it over to him (Dr. F); they are to have another trial tomorrow and I hope they will try to get through with it as he will have but a short time to prepare it; he will have to speak on 18th.

Went over this morning to F.U. at 11 ½ had no recitation till that hour and consequently did not attend chapel; Dr. Furman was not there and Dr. Edwards had excused the class; I immediately returned without reciting at all; went over and back in about 25 mins. Sissy sent for me to come down in Ma’s room this morning after came back from F.U. and told me in Ma’s presence (she had been talking to Ma before) that she wished to marry Mr. C. H. Toy and go with him to Japan as a Missionary and asked my opinion; I told her that was a matter she must decide; she then said she had left it to Ma and Ma was unwilling; Dr. Broadus had been talking to Ma this morning and she was very much excited I therefore refrained from saying anything this morning but will talk to her about it the first chance I have; she says it would be a great loss to us all (and it would) and thinks Sissy’s first duty is to her brothers and sisters; is besides not willing to trust her with Mr. Toy; don’t think he loved her. I would as soon see her marry Toy as any man I know and though of course I would much prefer to have her near us and had always expected to have her so, though she would be a great loss to me and greater to some of the others, the need of Missionaries is so great that I can’t object to her going although my feelings are all opposed to it; I had rather be separated from all the rest than her. Tonight about 9 o’clock heard Gen Patrick from Cal delegate to Natl Dem Conv at Charleston, delivering a fool speech; he was called out at Goodfelt’s house; very senseless I thought; Perry and others did much better.

I talked to Ella Townes and Mattie Duncan most of the time; took “Little Soph” (Miss Sophie McDaniel) to supper; we had a fine supper and I did it justice as I generally do; Dr. Boyce, Manly and Broadus with their wives were there with a number of others; and Misses Lane of N.Y.

Dr. Williams preached us an excellent sermon this morning though very short; his text was “All that new would praise the Lord for his goodness” part of 107th Psalms. Stopped raining about 9 o’clock, and the sun shone out part of the day. Attended Young Men’s Miss Soc of F.U. this evening; Doctor spoke (rather badly) I thought; I gave them 25 cents; took supper with Doctor and Furman Dargan at Mrs. Anderson’s tonight.

Misses Sophie D’Oylay and Lidia Croft were there. Dr. Johnson spoke at prayer meeting this evening; we had quite a good attendance out: Mr. Furman gave notice that the church would be opened for the recitation of candidates for Baptism tomorrow evening. O may we see many forsaking the ways of the world and leaning into God and may we who profess to be His devote ourselves a fresh to Him and His glorious work!

Adelphian Society anniversary was celebrated tonight; Horne gave us a good address and delivered it well; Something to do was his subject; it was well handled Drs. Broadus, Boyce, Furman, and Manly (the last acting as Chaplain) congratulated him and spoke in high terms of his effort; also Old Pete (Professor Edwards I should have said). There was a good audience out and they heard something worth hearing it was plain common sense, no fancy sketch of the imagination. We well may be proud of such an Adelphian and he may well be proud of the ability necessary for such a production; everyone seemed pleased and many were I hope otherwise benefitted.

After the adoption of the resolutions and while the com. to appoint delegates to Columbia were out we had speeches from Will H Easley and H Lee Houston both strong secessionists, the boys (F.U.) called them out and applauded them frequently; the meeting had very much appearance of a secession affair but I am much mistaken if Greenville District will support any such principles. We had a very pleasant prayer meeting this evening; afterwards I walked out nearly a mile to meet Sissie and Sue Moore who had been out to visit a poor family the other side of the old race-track Sissie and I took Sue Moore home.

Were I a secessionist (they will present him with she stick for making a secession speech) I would sooner give a stick to almost anyone else than HL Houston; I am not, and would not contribute to give any secessionist one on account of his political views, think this stick-business exceedingly foolish any way.

Attended Adelphian Society this evening and Laws of Temperance tonight; 3 joined Adel Soc. and 3 joined Division. Heard a speech from JP Reed of Anderson tonight at the Mansion House on Politics; Democratic Conventions of course he dwelt on at length; I thought he tried to stay “on the fence.” He advises that when the Richmond Convention assembles it shall immediately adjourn and await the result of the Baltimore Convention if a Southern anti- Douglas man is nominated by that Convention then the Richmond Convention he advises should endorse the Baltimore nomination. I think him inconsistent; he advises this, the south to vote for a man running on a platform upon which the Richmond Convention would not nominate a candidate retired in Charleston from Last Coon. Although he believed a southern man could be nominated on the same platform, on which nominated by Baltimore Convention he advises we should give our support. I am a southern man, union man; believe Baltimore Convention would endorse Richmond nominee if a southern man.

Attended drill this evening; after drill at a called meeting UR decided to go on an encampment at the end of this session for several days; I opposed but if we can get as much time as it is now thought by many we can, I am perfectly willing to go. Attended First Anniversary Celebration of “Andrew Fuller Society” of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary tonight; J.A.

Mrs. Stewart and Miss Sue Wright were here at supper; also the Misses Curry and Miss Holloway; the 1st two are sisters of Will L Curry; Mr. Marsh of Theolog Sem was here also. I took one of Curry’s sisters out, Marsh the other and Hazel Scaife took Miss Holloway; Haze took supper with us also Will L Curry. We all carried on a shamefully foolish frivolous conversation from the time we came home from communion till we went to church at night.

Dr. Boyce then gave us an address meant to be a touching farewell address but which in my opinion fell as far short of such an one as any I ever heard, while at the same time he labored very hard indeed; the choir of Bapt Church performed on the occasion and gave them good music and very appropriate too I thought. We had a warm prayer meeting this evening; Jones and other Theolog students spoke and Professor Furman gave us a most feeling though short address. God grant we may all be aroused. I took tea with Chambliss tonight at Rodlphus Long’s; he is going off in the morning as are most of Sem students. Betty received a letter from Benson Jones tonight; quite interesting; I finished mine to him but will add a few lines in the morning. Dr. Boyce gives a large party at his tonight; a great many will be there; I heard that no one would be invited but that everybody who desired to do so might come; I have understood since that some have been invited and of course I could not go without an invite. Col Townes (G. F.) was here when I came home; took tea here and remained a while after.

Philosophians Anniversary Party came off tonight at the Mansion House; I went down and staid till 10 ½ o’clock when I came home; a few of the Adelphians joined with some of the Philos. and took some of the company (ladies) into another room and commenced dancing although the Philos. Soc had voted down a proposition to allow dancing; didn’t feel I was doing right to… such proceedings as to a certain extent I was doing by being present at the place. I only talked to Sue Moore didn’t speak to any other lady; will get a good night’s rest; John Willingham took Sue Moore out. Profs Furman and Edwards were there and I thought out of respect to them the boys ought not to have danced there and they (the boys) were asked not to do so but they seemed bent on mischief and some were naturally such fools that no argument c’d have any weight with them. This is a beautiful night and I c’d have enjoyed it much but for this affair.

Profs left before the close of the affair; they (a part of those present I mean) danced in the dining room till Luandale wished to arrange the supper table when they (the dancers) came into the piazza before the Profs and danced there. Profs then left; Prof F was deeply affected and had a perfect night; such utter disregard of all propriety and contemptuous insulting conduct towards him c’d come from none but lawless minds. I have very little this morning and have been engaged in the same unprofitable employment the greater part of the evening. Went over to UR Company meeting at 4 o’clock; we had a parade at 5 o’clock w’h however was short; don’t feel tired at all tonight. J. W.

We had a parade this morning and Tho’s S Adams’ speech before the University Riflemen; Butler Guards were out at Miles Southern’s at a Fourth of July celebration; we were invited but I was glad we did not go; we only had the Band to play for us marching up the street and while in the CH to play till the address began when they left and went into the country to Miles Southern’s; Tho’s Adams’ speech was a very good one something practical and plain and for that reason better than speeches on such occasions generally are. After the parade hot weather and Frank Perry’s death too w’h last event prevented our making any unnecessary display or noise, we elected our officers (Lieuts) for next session; Tho’s Adams is 1st, T P Gaines 2nd and A Blythe 3rd; we transacted some other business and then adjourned.

We had a fine shower just after dinner, A.M.’s were to have had a meeting this evening immediately after dinner and elect the Valedictory orator; the A.B.’s were to elect the Salutatory; I did not go around until too late when I met Dr. coming away; I believe we will give it up as some are opposed to the measure. Dr. and I went into Dr. Earle’s Library this evening at this request and looked over some of his books of w’h he has many excellent ones; he offered to lend us any work or to allow us the use of his books in his library at any time we might choose to come in; we will avail ourselves of the opportunity this afforded us of acquiring information on the subject we may choose for our commencement themes.

At prayer meeting this evening the doors of the church were opened and 7 read as candidates for Baptism; Ella Townes, Will H Goldsmith, Sam’l Furman, and Miss Harriet Graham. Thanks be to God for this manifestation of His mercy by w’h we see some coming out and acknowledging the Lord! O how glad I was to see Ella and Alice among that number.

Attended Div. tonight and was installed R.S. although I was anxious someone else sh’d take the office yet as they or some at least seemed desirous of my keeping it I consented to do so, the Div. is improving now owning principally I think to the resignation of some very undesirable members.

Riflemen paid them extra this morning. Ja’s P Moore delivered the address before the Alumni Association yesterday morning to a good audience though I didn’t think anything extra in his speech; his pretended moral sentiments w’h from his conduct at  Edgefield C.H., I am compelled to put down as hypocritical disgusted me; although a professor of religion he has led a highly immoral vicious life for some months past. Was very sorry indeed that Y.J. and I c’d not parade with UR this morning but it was impossible almost for me to do so as we had to dress and get ready for the speech making. We (our class) all got thro’ much better than we expected, I think at least I know I did. Much to my surprise I was calm and cool as c’d be when I first came out but from excitement or fright before I finished was very much agitated; I never was as much excited in my life before and hope I never will be again; I … we all did remarkably well though not competent to judge; if my speech had only been my own instead of Prof E’s I sh’d have felt much better delivering it.

Carried Cos. Anna Jones home as I bro’t her from home; in going home I too her past the house and had a good  long moon light walk up as far as Female College; got home about 2; did not leave Mansion House till nearly everybody else had left; Cos. Anna is a might clever little girl though most too fast; think she w’d like to flirt some if she had the chance to do so. Cos Laura is quite different and though not near so pretty yet I like  her much better; she is well educated much better every way she is more sensible more intelligent less fond of show and attentions from young men; does not paint or grease her head, both of w’h disgusting practices cos Anna follows at least I am fully convinced that she does.

We intended stopping at a Dr. Rice’s two miles back but the master of the house was away and although we were told we might stop we declined doing so and  came on here after night; they prepared us a very good supper here but my appetite was not very good and I c’d not enjoy it as I otherwise w’d have done; but I hope they will soon be all right again; it is something unusual for me to have little or no appetite and is a sure sign that there is something wrong; part of the time I am costive and part of the time on the other extreme; when I get quietly settled down at Ned’s I think everything will come out right. I ate some sweet potatoes at Dr. Sweat’s today the first I have tasted this season, they were not very good, had very little taste about them.

Brabham’s about 7 ½ o’clock this morning and dined at the plantation belonging to Mr. Tho’s Willingham w’h a driver (negro man) named Billy has under his charge; he is a very intelligent boy and acts and speaks as if the place belonged to him; calls it his place; he gave us a nice dinner some fine sweet potatoes w’h I enjoyed very much; we didn’t intend stopping there but Billy told us his master w’d be there to dinner and we staid expecting to see him but he failed to come so we were disappointed. Maj Brabham refused to make any charge this morning for our stay last night; he treated us finely and seemed to be quite a nice man. To-night I am at Ned’s and already feel quite at home, we got here about 3 ½ or 4  (32 or 33 miles the distance we have come today); we had a fine shower here a short time after we arrived; after the shower Col. W. went on to his father’s (about 4 miles); the rain cooled the atmosphere somewhat and I don’t find it as hot now as I expected since the whole morning was very hot indeed on the road. Ned is somewhat unwell, with the same complaint I have been troubled with, though I think he looks better now than when he came up to Greenville. I like his wife’s looks very much; his little boy is a bright little fellow and fine looking.

We arrived in Sav’h about 4 ½ and went out shopping as Ned’s wife gave him a list of articles she wanted and he had to buy some for himself and some for a brother in law (J J Kirb) he has living with him.

I am very much pleased with the country up here; I think it as pleasant as any country I have ever been in; both the Willinghams (TH and BL) have nice, very nice places indeed and fine lands too I expect from what I have heard; they both have fine houses and live well and enjoy what they have. Mrs BLW is a very nice lady and their children are very sprightly little chaps; they have 9! The oldest not 12 yet. His wife Mrs. THW and Miss Martha Lawton’s mother (Dr. Jas.

Mr. Estes has a large fine place here; he has a beautiful yard (flower garden) in front of his house and a very healthy lawn too. This evening Dr. J C Staney Lawton his wife and Miss Martha came over to Mr. MLW’s; Miss Martha looks very much the same she did when I saw her last though she is whiter, looks more like a white girl and more like a woman; I fear she has become somewhat worldly from some things I have heard and from her conversation; God of Heaven grant in mercy grant that my fears may be incorrect and grant that she be among your children on earth and within the “Redeemed” in Heaven may she stand!

This evening we all had intended going over to Lutheran College to hear a speech from one of the “boys” there but a lady came in and prevented cos Anna and Sissy; Benson and I rode over however and though we were disappointed about the speech heard Dr. Brown lecture on “illegal voting” of w’h several students had been guilty. We then looked thro’ the College Building and think it will do very well though the college is nothing like as finely finished as FU; saw a Mr. Pifer a tutor who is not (in my opinion) anything extraordinary.

Benson and I left Glenn’s this morning about 10 o’clock and reached Limestone Springs at 5 this evening 28 miles distant; we came by Cedar Spring’s Deaf and Dumb Asylum but didn’t stop; crossed Pacolet River at “Thos’ Ford” (a pretty rough ford too) as the bridge at Rolling Mills where we intended crossing was down; we had rather a cool windy drive but quite a pleasant time; we went over to Dr. Curtis’ after supper, our faces as red as fire (from the wind), and asked for Betty; Mrs. C thought it unprudent for her to come over thro’ the rain and we went over to the Seminary building and staid till 9 o’clock with her, Benson and I; she seemed weak and took a hearty cry over our arrival, looked flushed and far from well but hope she will be better by morning and will see what must be done about her; Dr. C is not at home but I will find out whether he will give her fore or not and if he refuses to do so I will advise Ma to take her home.

Saw Bettie this morning and sat some time with her; told her and Sallie and Annie B and Belle W good bye. Miss Howe sent Benson and I two fine large apples just as we were leaving for w’h we are very much obliged to her; was sorry didn’t get to bid her and Miss Jenny good bye. We left about 11 o’clock having p’d $3.75 each at Hotel Benson insisting on paying half horse bill though I hadn’t intended it … Left Limestone Springs at 11 o’clock this morning and arrived here at 8 ½ tonight! A distance not exceeding 26 miles (according to some not more than 20 miles) but we (Benson and I) are fully convinced that it is 26 at least; it is the worst road and the hardest to find I ever saw; from Pacolet Depot here we had no road only “pieces” as a man we came across told us; we drove thro’ the gates over gullies, bogs, stumps, and rough roads in general till about 7 (having lost the road at least and I having been compelled to get out and walk one or two miles to find the road and show Benson the way while he drove) when we reached Mr. Black’s about 3 miles off where we hired a negro to show is the way here and lead our horses (for w’h I p’d him 50 cts) part of the way; he bro’t us a bye road merely the roughest I ever saw and one I’m convinced we w’d never have found so many bye-roads leading from it; we have accomplished a desperate undertaking and think we are fully determined never to try this road again; we were very much amused by the various directions and distances we were given by various persons along the route. Lady was tender footed having no shoes on behind and c’d not trot at all scarcely, w’h made us so late getting here and then the road was so bad, muddy aswell as possessed of every other bad quality hilly, rough, stumpy and c that I only wonder we got here at all. Benson rec’d 2 letters and any no. of papers from home tonight; his father wrote he might go home with me. We went over to the house and I took supper while Benson only drank some egg-nog.

We took a good walk before dinner, and another before dark this evening; in our last we walked back to the road we came last night and think it almost impossible to go over that road at night and scarcely safe to do so in the day time.

Mr. Simmons got home from Laurens with his daughter Miss Millie who is another Mildred Watson, if I can judge from a short conversation with her tonight and from what I had previously heard of her; I talked with her most of the time while Bettie talked with Benson.

I fastened Lady so that she had to stand in the branch as that had been prescribed for her; she still limps, but I think scarcely as much as she did yesterday. Bishop Davis (Episcopal Bishop for this State) and son with 2 or 3 other Episcopal preachers took dinner with us at Mr. Simmons’ today; we had a fine dinner and I did full justice to it as also did several others; they are making a gr’t “to do” over the Bishop, have been preparing for him on an extensive scale.

About ½ the road (this half) was better by far than I expected to find it; it was not muddy and more level than the rest of it. We found flags flying and tremendous excitement here; a political meeting w’h began at 11 this morning was still going on when we arrived; Prof JC Furman made a speech this morning w’h is praised by ever one in the most extravagant terms; he, Gen WH Easley, Col WH Campbell, PE Duncan, and Dr. Harrison are the candidates for delegates to represent this District in the state convention to assemble in Col’a Dec. 17th and they will no doubt be elected; I am a Secessionist now although I have never been before; I can’t bear the idea of living under a Blk.
